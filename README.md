# Bintopia

This web app helps you organize your stuff into storage bins. While you're moving things around between bins, you call out what you are doing, e.g. "I'm adding a hammer to bin #5", and an assistant updates your inventory. It uses purely local LLM and speech recognition so that all your data is kept private.

## Current State

It's in a proof-of-concept stage. Maybe I decide to abandon it. But early signs are good that it will be a useful app.

## Contributing

The project isn't open to contributions at this point. But that could change. Contact me if you'd like to collaborate.

## Contacting

You can reach me via my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikhermansen/). I'll accept connections if you will just mention "decent apps" or some other shared interest in your connection request.
